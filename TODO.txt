THINGS TO DO

There are two ways SMSLib could be improved. The first is fairly
trivial: smslibtest should thoroughly test ALL of the SMSLib functions,
not just the main ones.

The second will be much more difficult: fix SMSLib's reliability problem
on certain G4-based laptops. On the PowerBook5,6, PowerBook5,7,
PowerBook6,7 and PowerBook6,8 models, SMSLib will suddenly stop working,
and won't start working again until the machine is rebooted. I've been
unable to solve this, partly because I don't have access to any such
machines, but also because the issue is governed by some internal Apple
code and I don't have the tools or experience for such low-level
debugging.

When SMSLib works on these machines, it uses the service
"IOI2CMotionSensor" with selector 21 and a 60 byte record. When it
fails, it outputs the following error record:

Trying service "IOI2CMotionSensor" with selector 21 and 60 byte record:
    Fetching dictionary for service: success.
    Getting list of matching services: success.
    Getting first device in list: success.
    Opening device: success.
    Testing device.
    Querying device: failed.
    Failure testing device, with result 0xe00002e9.

Any and all ideas on how to fix this would be appreciated!


Thanks,
