CREDITS

Although the code is all my own, when accessing the Sudden Motion Sensor
I used techniques discovered by a number of people:

Amit Singh (see http://www.kernelthread.com/software/ams)

Pall Thayer (see http://pallit.lhi.is/palli/dashlevel)

Randy Green (see http://www.slappingturtle.com/home)


When enhancing the library to be 64-bit capable, I used hints sent me by
Vitus Lorenz-Meyer <derdoc@googlemail.com> and Ryan Schmukler <schmukler@wisc.edu>.
Thanks, gentlemen.


Thanks also to the people who have written. Thanks especially to those
who have given clear and informative bug reports: you made improving
SMSLib a lot easier.
